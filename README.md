# huffman_encrypt

   Hi,
   In this project, there is a menu that can be used to perform Huffman encryption in two ways by selecting the desired option:
1. In this case, you will be asked for the address of three files in the input, the first is the address of the file that you want to be encrypted, and the second is the file that stores the Huffman code of each letter of the first file, and the third file is the final encrypted file. ; If this process is done correctly, you will be shown the appropriate message on the console screen.
2. In this case, you enter a text directly and you will receive the Huffman coded text .
Good luck
